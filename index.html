            <p>
              Tic Tac Toe is a classic pencil-and-paper game for two players.
              Played on a 3x3 grid, opponents take turns marking empty squares
              with Xs or Os. The objective is to get three of your symbols in a
              row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your
              opponent does. The game ends when one player achieves this goal,
              or if the entire grid is filled without a winner, resulting in a
              draw. It's a quick, strategic game often enjoyed by people of all
              ages. Additionally, users can play this engaging game with a
              computer for an entertaining solo experience.

            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <p>
              In Tic Tac Toe, players alternate placing Xs and Os. The first to
              create a row of three of their marks wins. If the grid fills up
              without a winner, the game ends in a draw. When playing with a
              computer, the same rules apply, providing a familiar and enjoyable
              experience for solo players.
